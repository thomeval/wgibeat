= Introduction =

This page contains some of the less obvious features of WGiBeat. Most players will benefit from knowing this information. More will be added as features are implemented or updated.

==Changing difficulty or beatline speed easily==
The beatline speed and difficulty for each player is displayed on many screens at the bottom of the screen, along with the associated profile name (if any).

When this frame is visible, press and hold the SELECT key. The current difficulty and beatline speed will then be displayed as text next to the icons. While holding the SELECT key, press LEFT or RIGHT to change your difficulty, or UP and DOWN to change your beatline speed.

This can be done from any screen that displays the Player Options Frame, including the Song Select and Mode Select screens.

==Changing the song sort order==
The song sort order is displayed near the top right corner of the song select screen. By default, songs are sorted alphabetically by title. To change this, hold the BEATLINE key, and press left or right. Any player can do this.

==Song Debugging==
Song debugging is a useful feature that allows players to change the offset, BPM or length of a song on-the-fly while it is being played. This is most useful to fine-tune a song that is not synchronized properly. By default, song debugging is disabled, and must be enabled from the options menu by setting "Song Debugging" to "On". 

Once enabled, the song's current BPM, length, offset and phrase number (position) will be displayed in the middle frame of the screen during gameplay.

The following keys can be used to adjust the BPM, length or offset of the song. These are the same as the keys used during the "Tuning" step in WGiEdit. Changes are saved once the song gameplay is completed (when the evaluation screen is displayed).

F5 - Decrease BPM by 0.1
F6 - Increase BPM by 0.1
F7 - Decrease Offset by 0.1
F8 - Increase Offset by 0.1
F9 - Decrease Offset by 0.01
F10 - Increase Offset by 0.01
F11 - Decrease Length by 0.1 
F12 - Increase Length by 0.1

IMPORTANT: Once changes are made to a song's BPM, length or offset, all of the song's high scores will be invalidated. This is by design to avoid cheating.
