#summary An explanation on how to add downloaded songs (such as song packs) to WGiBeat

= Basics =

WGiBeat songs are normally stored in a Songs folder. This folder is created as part of the installation process.

Inside this folder, individual songs can be located in any number of subf olders as desired, as long as each song's definition file (.sng, .sm or .dwi) and its corresponding audio file (.mp3 or .ogg) are in the same folder. Songs provided on the WGiBeat website are usually arranged into sub folders for each artist.

Songs created with WGiEdit (the song editor), are stored in the sub folder specified during Step 1 of the creation process, inside the same Songs folder.

If desired, the location of the WGiBeat Songs folder can be changed to any other folder that WGiBeat has read/write access to, by changing the SongFolder line in the settings.txt file. It is also possible to use multiple song folders - see the [TipsAndTricks page] for more information.
