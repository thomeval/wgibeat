#CPUSKILL-1.0;
#Format: Each line is considered a skill level. These can be in any level, but having them in order of increasing
#skill level is recommended. The skill levels are defined by specifying the weights (likelihood) of each judgement type.
#These weights do not have to add up to 100. The heigher the weight specified for a specific judgement, the more likely
#the CPU will attain this judgement while playing on the given skill level.
#The lines themselves are ordered as follows: [IDEAL,COOL,OK,BAD,FAIL,MISS,STREAK_MAX]
#STREAK_MAX is the maximum number of consecutive ideals the CPU player can obtain (to prevent luck based pwnage).
