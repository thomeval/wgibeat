WGiBeat is a basic rhythm game built using Microsoft XNA. The basic gameplay was inspired by several existing rhythm games. The latest source is available through SVN.

Note that WGiBeat is not intended to be a clone of [Stepmania](http://www.stepmania.com/), as it does not feature DDR/ITG/PIU style gameplay.

Developers are welcome to participate in WGiBeat's development. For instructions, please contact the developers at wgibeat{at}gmail{dot}com.
