Option1=Allows adjustments to be made to a song's BPM, length and offset during gameplay.\nUse the F3 to F12 keys.
Option2=This affects how the game treats MD5 validation of audio (.mp3) files. \nSet to 'Ignore' to disable and decrease initial loading times.\nSet to 'Auto Correct' to correct invalid MD5 hashes automatically.
Option3=If enabled, the game log (displayed when the game is started)\n is saved to log.txt when the game is closed. It is helpful for troubleshooting.
Option4=This option determines how much information is logged.\n Setting this to 'Debug or Above' will cause all log information to be recored. Higher levels will result in less information.
Option5=This changes the currently active theme.\n Themes are stored in separate folders in the Content\Textures folder.
Option6=Determines whether WGiBeat should allow or ignore songs that are known \n to be problematic, such as .sm or .dwi songs that have negative BPMs or Stops. 
Option7=Determines whether any song files loaded that are not in .sng format should be saved as .sng files.\n Since the original .dwi or .sm files are never changed by WGiBeat, this is required to make such files editable.
Option8=Adjusts the size of the game's resolution. Higher settings will look nicer but require a faster system.
Option9=Switches between windowed and full-screen mode.\nPressing Alt + Enter will also toggle full screen mode temporarily.
Option10=Enables or disables vertical sync.\nIf enabled, the frame rate will be limited to the refresh rate of the monitor.\nThis should be disabled on slower systems.

Option12=Controls the maximum brightness of the animated background during gameplay.\n This should be turned off on slower systems.
